abstract: "Classically, neuropsychological evaluation only estimates an
  individual’s performance at one time point. For example, working memory (WM)
  capacity is commonly determined in a single test session. However, recent
  research in WM plasticity and variability has suggested performance over
  several sessions/days might aid in evaluating children. Here, we explored four
  temporal properties of WM: WM measured once, as a mean over three days
  (multiple-session-baseline performance), variability over 8 weeks, and
  performance improvement over an 8-week WM training program. To examine
  independence we controlled for a single-session, multiple task WM assessment
  while predicting inattention and mathematics three years later (n = 178, mean
  age 80 months at training, 49 % boys). Our results showed improved prediction
  for mathematics from WM training improvement and variability, yet this was not
  the case for inattention. While the additional variance added was not
  substantial, our results indicate clinically relevant information present in
  these alternative WM measures."
