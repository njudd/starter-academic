abstract: "The influence of socioeconomic status (SES) inequalities on brain and
  cognitive development is a hotly debated topic. However, previous studies have
  not considered that genetic factors overlap with SES. Here we show that SES
  and EduYears-PGS (a score from thousands of genetic markers for educational
  attainment) have independent associations with both cognition and global
  cortical surface area in adolescents. EduYears-PGS also had a localized
  association in the brain: the intraparietal sulcus, a region related to
  nonverbal intelligence. In contrast, SES had global, but not regional,
  associations, and these persisted throughout adolescence. This suggests that
  the influence of SES inequalities is widespread—a result that opposes the
  current paradigm and can help inform policies in education."
