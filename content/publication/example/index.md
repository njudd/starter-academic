abstract: "The influence of socioeconomic status (SES) inequalities on brain and
  cognitive development is a hotly debated topic. However, previous studies have
  not considered that genetic factors overlap with SES. Here we show that SES
  and EduYears-PGS (a score from thousands of genetic markers for educational
  attainment) have independent associations with both cognition and global
  cortical surface area in adolescents. EduYears-PGS also had a localized
  association in the brain: the intraparietal sulcus, a region related to
  nonverbal intelligence. In contrast, SES had global, but not regional,
  associations, and these persisted throughout adolescence. This suggests that
  the influence of SES inequalities is widespreadâ€”a result that opposes the
  current paradigm and can help inform policies in education."
