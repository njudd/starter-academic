abstract: Spatial and mathematical abilities are strongly associated. Here, we
  analysed data from 17,648 children, aged 6â€“8 years, who performed 7 weeks of
  mathematical training together with randomly assigned spatial cognitive
  training with tasks demanding more spatial manipulation (mental rotation or
  tangram), maintenance of spatial information (a visuospatial working memory
  task) or spatial, non-verbal reasoning. We found that the type of cognitive
  training children performed had a significant impact on mathematical learning,
  with training of visuospatial working memory and reasoning being the most
  effective. This large, community-based study shows that spatial cognitive
  training can result in transfer to academic abilities, and that reasoning
  ability and maintenance of spatial information is relevant for mathematics
  learning in young children.
