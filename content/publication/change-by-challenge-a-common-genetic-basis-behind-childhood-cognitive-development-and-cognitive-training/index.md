abstract: "The interplay of genetic and environmental factors behind cognitive
  development has preoccupied multiple fields of science and sparked heated
  debates over the decades. Here we tested the hypothesis that developmental
  genes rely heavily on cognitive challengesâ€”as opposed to natural maturation.
  Starting with a polygenic score (cogPGS) that previously explained variation
  in cognitive performance in adults, we estimated its effect in 344 children
  and adolescents (mean age of 12 years old, ranging from 6 to 25) who showed
  changes in working memory (WM) in two distinct samples: (1) a developmental
  sample showing significant WM gains after 2 years of typical, age-related
  development, and (2) a training sample showing significant,
  experimentally-induced WM gains after 25 days of an intense WM training. We
  found that the same genetic factor, cogPGS, significantly explained the amount
  of WM gain in both samples. And there was no interaction of cogPGS with
  sample, suggesting that those genetic factors are neutral to whether the WM
  gains came from development or training. These results represent evidence that
  cognitive challenges are a central piece in the gene-environment interplay
  during cognitive development. We believe our study sheds new light on previous
  findings of interindividual differences in education (rich-get-richer and
  compensation effects), brain plasticity in children, and the heritability
  increase of intelligence across the lifespan."
