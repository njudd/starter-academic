abstract: Schooling, socioeconomic status (SES), and genetics all play large
  roles in intelligence differences. However, it is unclear to what extent their
  contributions are unique and if they interact. Here we used a multitrait
  polygenic score for cognition (cog-PGS) with a quasi-experimental regression
  discontinuity design to isolate how months of schooling relate to intelligence
  in 7,853 children (aged 9-11). We found large, independent effects of
  schooling, cog-PGS, and SES on working memory, crystallized (cIQ), and fluid
  intelligence (fIQ). Intriguingly, we found evidence for gene-by-environment
  interplay between cog-PGS and SES for cIQ, and a trend in the same direction
  for fIQ. This interaction was negative meaning that the intelligence of the
  highest SES children was the least affected by genetic differences, while the
  lowest SES children were most affected by genetic variability. Schooling
  showed no interaction with cog-PGS or SES for the three intelligence domains
  tested. While schooling had strong main effects on intelligence, it did not
  lessen, nor widen the impact of these preexisting SES or genetic factors.
