abstract: "Abstract: Spatial and mathematical abilities are strongly associated.
  Here we analyzed data from 17,648 children, aged 6-8 years, who performed 7
  weeks of mathematical training, together with randomly assigned, spatial
  cognitive training with tasks demanding more of spatial manipulation (mental
  rotation or tangram), maintenance of spatial information (a visuo-spatial
  working memory task) or spatial, non-verbal reasoning. We found that what type
  of cognitive training children performed had a significant impact on
  mathematical learning, with training of visuo-spatial working memory and
  reasoning being the most effective. This large, community-based study shows
  that spatial cognitive training can result in transfer to academic abilities
  and that reasoning ability and maintenance of spatial information is relevant
  for math learning in young children."
